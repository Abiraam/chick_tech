# Introduction to building a Basic Webpage 
## [Tools and Basic Understandings](tools.md) 
## [Step-by-Step Webpage with Libraries](step_by_step/steps.md)



## Intro will consist of: 
 
  * Creation of a README using github-flavored markdown for documentation
  * A step-by-step build of a basic one page data display website making use of Libraries (Plotly, D3, JQuery) and Bootstrap front-end framework using  pre-flighted code. ( HTML, CSS, JS) Here's the [example](https://griffin-starter.herokuapp.com/index.html) 
  * A very basic intro to how the data is being displayed in each visualization case, and how they can manipulate the data to personalize it. 
  * Creation of a personal Heroku production site
  * Preparation of our code for our live site by adding an index.php file ( Used as a Build Pack, which Heroku needs to build a production site)
  * Push from github to the production site, where their friends, family and Chick Tech look at their work!

##[Bootstrap Charts](https://mdbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
	* use another CDN (Content delivery network) to create bootstrap responsive charts 

	* embed the cdns in the header and copy and paste the examples and play around with how they are built.
