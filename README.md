## Overview: Setting the Stage: Environment and  Expectations
## The State of Things:
Most Tech employees are currently white and male 20-45 y/o, Women & Minorities in Tech much lower & the Workforce is Projected to grow significantly by W/Minorities in next 10 years, BUT number of W/M expected to enter Tech DECREASING.

 * [Treehouse blog Article about Practical application for non-programmers](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/havent-started-programming-yet) 
 
 ## Meta-Goals:
When you have completed this workshop, you should understand:

* Vocabulary  
* Some basic web development principles and command line syntax
* How to get your application into a Github repository
* Some basic toolds that a developer uses
* A bit about the state of the demographics of Technology presently, projections for the next 10 yrs, and some steps you can take. 


 ## Some Tools and Basic Understandings
 
* Cloud 9 Internet Development Environment (C9 IDE) & Terminal
* Git and Github
* (Hopefully Heroku, if we have enough time!) 
* Some Libraries: [Plotly](https://plot.ly/javascript/), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Some HTML/CSS/Javascript
* Understanding a bit about showing your data
* Some Programming Terminology and beginning data structures

  ##  Here's an Overview of what we'll do:

  * Make sure we've signed up for all the services we need.
  * Create a README.md page and see how it works. 
  * Craft a nifty one-page website with some data using HTML, CSS and some libraries. Here's the [example](https://shielded-mesa-33567.herokuapp.com/index.html) 
  * Add a git repository and push our initial site code to github. 
  * Add some graphs to our site to personalize, and learn a bit about how that works for each.  
  * Add a video. 
  * Prepare our code for our live site by adding an index.php file  
  * Initiate a Heroku repository and push our code to that live site
