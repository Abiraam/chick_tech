## Overview: Setting the Stage: Environment and  Expectations
## The State of Things:
Most Tech employees are currently white and male 20-45 y/o, Women & Minorities in Tech much lower & the Workforce is Projected to grow significantly by W/Minorities in next 10 years, BUT number of W/M expected to enter Tech DECREASING.

Supporting readings from White house directive on STEM and NSF/ Other supporting stuff:

 ## What can we do about it?  
  
 * [Douglas Rushkoff: Program or be Programmed](http://www.rushkoff.com/about/)
 * [Treehouse blog Article about Practical application for non-programmers](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/havent-started-programming-yet) 
 
 ## Meta-Goals:
When you have completed this workshop, you should understand:

* Vocabulary  
* Some basic web development principles and command line syntax
* How to get your application into a Github repository
* Some basic toolds that a developer uses
* A bit about the state of the demographics of Technology presently, projections for the next 10 yrs, and some steps you can take. 


 ## Some Tools and Basic Understandings
 
* Cloud 9 Internet Development Environment (C9 IDE) & Terminal
* Git and Github
* (Hopefully Heroku, if we have enough time!) 
* Some Libraries: [Plotly](https://plot.ly/javascript/), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Some HTML/CSS/Javascript
* Understanding a bit about showing your data
* Some Programming Terminology and beginning data structures
* [Steps for a C9/Github Push](https://github.com/AlliVaughn/griffin_lvlup/blob/232821ea0dc6c008bc535085bf89f956fd151cc9/weeks/c9_github.md)
* [Github Flavored Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/dmikalova/sublime-cheat-sheets/blob/master/cheat-sheets/Github%20Flavored%20Markdown.cheatsheet)

##  The ~6 hour Technical program will consist of: 
 
  * Standard LvlUp Overview of the State of Women in Tech, complete with links and numbers.
  * An intro to Cloud 9 IDE & Integrated Terminal 
  * Intro to Git and GitHub
  * Creation of a README using github-flavored markdown for documentation
  * A step-by-step build of a basic one page data display website making use of Libraries (Plotly, D3, JQuery) and Bootstrap front-end framework using  pre-flighted code. ( HTML, CSS, JS) Here's the [example](https://shielded-mesa-33567.herokuapp.com/index.html) 
  * A very basic intro to how the data is being displayed in each visualization case, and how they can manipulate the data to personalize it. 
  * Creation of a personal Heroku production site
  * Preparation of our code for our live site by adding an index.php file ( Used as a Build Pack, which Heroku needs to build a production site)
  * Push from github to the production site, where their friends, family and Chick Tech look at their work!
